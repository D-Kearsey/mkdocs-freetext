# MkDocs Free-Text Questions Plugin

A comprehensive MkDocs plugin for adding interactive free-text input questions and assessments to your documentation. Perfect for educational content, tutorials, and training materials.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Questions**: Add free-text input questions directly to your documentation
- **Multi-Question Assessments**: Create comprehensive assessments with multiple questions
- **Rich Content Support**: Questions support Mermaid diagrams, code blocks, images, and markdown
- **Material Theme Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MkDocs Material theme, including automatic dark/light mode support
- **Persistent Storage**: Auto-saves user answers in browser localStorage
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize appearance, behavior, and validation
- **Question Shuffling**: Optional randomization of assessment question order
- **Character Counting**: Optional character counter for text inputs
- **Sample Answers**: Show/hide sample answers for learning reinforcement
- **Clean Separation**: Use `---` separator to cleanly separate question content from configuration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install mkdocs-freetext
```

### Basic Configuration

Add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - freetext
```

### Simple Question Example

```markdown
!!! freetext
    What is the capital of France?
    
    ---
    marks: 2
    placeholder: Enter your answer here...
    show_answer: true
    answer: Paris is the capital of France.
```

### Rich Content Question Example

```markdown
!!! freetext
    Analyze this code and explain what it does:
    
    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    ```
    
    What is the time complexity of this algorithm?
    
    ---
    marks: 10
    type: long
    rows: 6
    placeholder: Explain the algorithm and its complexity...
```

### Question with Images and Diagrams

```markdown
!!! freetext
    Study the system architecture below:
    
    ![System Architecture](images/architecture.png)
    
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
        B --> C[Web Server 1]
        B --> D[Web Server 2]
        C --> E[Database]
        D --> E
    ```
    
    How would you scale this system to handle 10x more traffic?
    
    ---
    marks: 15
    type: long
    rows: 8
```

### Assessment Example

```markdown
!!! freetext-assessment
    title: Python Basics Assessment
    shuffle: true
    
    question: What is a variable in Python?
    marks: 3
    placeholder: Describe what a variable is...
    
    ---
    
    question: Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.
    marks: 5
    placeholder: Compare lists and tuples...
```

| `enable_css` | boolean | `true` | Enable built-in CSS styling |
| `shuffle_questions` | boolean | `false` | Shuffle question order in assessments |
| `show_character_count` | boolean | `true` | Show character counter on text inputs |

## üåü Examples

### Basic Question with Rich Content

```markdown
!!! freetext
    question: Analyze the following Python code and explain what it does:
    
    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    ```
    
    What is the time complexity of this implementation?
    
    marks: 5
    placeholder: Explain the code and analyze its complexity...
```

### Assessment with Mermaid Diagram

```markdown
!!! freetext-assessment
    title: System Design Assessment
    
    question: Based on this system architecture, identify potential bottlenecks:
    
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[User] --> B[Load Balancer]
        B --> C[Web Server 1]
        B --> D[Web Server 2]
        C --> E[Database]
        D --> E
    ```
    
    marks: 10
